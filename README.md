# **Mobile Shop Customer Management Application**

## **Overview**
This is a web-based application for an online mobile phone store maintaining a database of customers, mobiles and orders. This project provides CRUD functionality for Creating, Retrieving (Searching), Updating, and Deleting Customer, Mobile and Order information from a MongoDB database.

This project was made as part of my module, **Web Information Processing** in Maynooth University, National University of Ireland Maynooth.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap, Bootsnipp)
- JavaScript (jQuery, AJAX)

### Backend
- Express.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB Atlas
- CORS
- Postman

### Browser
- Google Chrome Version 126.0.6478.128 (Official Build) (64-bit)

### Operating System
- Windows

## Project Setup

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Node.js:**
   - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
   - Initialize npm: `cd backend` then `npm init -y`

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Express for the server: `npm i express`
   - Nodemon for automatic server restarts: `npm i nodemon`
   - Mongoose for MongoDB connection: `npm i mongoose`
   - Dotenv for environment variables: `npm i dotenv`
   - CORS for cross-origin requests: `npm i cors`

3. **Run the Backend:**
   - Start the server: `cd backend` then `npm run dev`
   - Expected output:
     ```
     [nodemon] 3.1.0
     [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
     [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
     [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,cjs,json
     [nodemon] starting `node index.js`
     App connected to the database!
     App is listening to port: 5555
     ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Create Frontend:**
   - Organize your project structure with a root directory (e.g., `assignment-05` or `mobile-shop`) containing folders for `frontend` and `backend`.

2. **Setup Frontend Environment:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
   - Create the required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files:
     - `assignment-05.html` or `index.html`
     - `assignment-05.style` or `styles.css`
     - `assignment-05-customerCRUD.js` or `scripts.js`

3. **Include Libraries and Frameworks:**
   - Use CDN links for Bootstrap, jQuery, and Bootsnipp components. Add Bootstrap and CSS in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:
     ```html
     <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
     
     <!-- Custom CSS -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="assignment-05.css">
     ```
    -Add jQuery and JS after the `</body>` section of your HTML file:

     ```
     </body>
      <!-- JQuery import -->
      <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
      
      <!-- Javascript files -->
      <script src="assignment-05-customerCRUD.js"></script>
      <script src="assignment-05-mobileCRUD.js"></script>
      <script src="assignment-05-orderCRUD.js"></script>
      
      </html>
     ```

4. **Run the Frontend:**
   - Right click `assignment-05.html`, then click 'Show in browser', to access the web application.

## DATABASE DESIGN

This project uses a NoSQL database design with MongoDB, focusing on collections for two main entities: `customer` and `mobilePhone`. These collections store documents that represent individual customer records and mobile phone models, respectively. A third collection, `order`, defines the relationship between customers and mobile phones, acting as a bridge to capture the mobile phones purchased by each customer.

### Data Modeling Approach

- **Entities and Collections**:
  - `customer`: Contains customer details like name, contact information, home, and shipping addresses.
  - `mobilePhone`: Contains details about mobile phone models, including manufacturer, model name, and price.
  
- **Relationship (orders)**:
  - The `order` collection links `customer` to the `mobilePhone` they've purchased. Each order document references a customer and lists one or more mobile phones, along with the quantity and total price.

  - **Customer Schema:**
  - `title`: String (e.g. Mr, Ms, etc.)
  - `firstName`: String
  - `surname`: String
  - `mobile`: String
  - `emailAddress`: String (unique)
  - `homeAddress`: Object with fields `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `town`, `county`, and `EIRCODE`
  - `shippingAddress`: Object with fields `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `town`, `county`, and `EIRCODE`

- **MobilePhone Schema:**
  - `manufacturer`: String
  - `model`: String
  - `price`: Number

- **Order Schema:**
  - `customer`: ObjectId (reference to `Customer`)
  - `items`: Array of objects with `mobilePhone` (ObjectId, reference to `MobilePhone`) and `quantity` (Number)
  - `totalPrice`: Number
  - `orderDate`: Date

### Cascading Deletes

- To maintain data integrity, middleware is used to handle cascading deletes:
  - When a customer is deleted, all associated orders in the `order` collection are automatically removed.
  - When a mobile phone model is deleted, any references to it in orders are also removed.

### Impact on Code Development

- **Pre-remove Middleware**: The use of pre-remove middleware in both the `customer` and `mobilePhone` schemas simplifies the process of maintaining referential integrity by automatically handling related data deletions.
- **Flexible Data Structure**: MongoDBâ€™s flexible document-based schema allows for future scalability, such as adding new fields to the customer or mobile phone documents without requiring significant schema modifications.

## Running the Project

1. **Backend:**
   - `cd backend`
   - `npm run dev`

2. **Frontend:**
   - Open `assignment-05.html` in your web browser.

## Frontend

## Overview

The frontend of this project is designed as a single HTML page that includes forms and interactive elements. The page provides CRUD functionality for Creating, Retrieving (Searching), Updating, and Deleting Customer, Mobile and Order information.

Customers, Mobiles and Orders each have:
1. **Create Form** - A form for adding new customers, mobiles or orders. Red asterix indicates a maditory field.
2. **Retrieve Form** - A search bar with an in page console view displaying the results in JSON format.  Can retrieve a customer, mobile or order randomly, by searching it's name or retrieve all the results.
3. **Update Form** - A form for updating a random customer, mobile or order information.
4. **Delete Form** - A deletion form based on composite key depending on the entity and a confirmation box to confirm deletion.


**JavaScript (AJAX and jQuery)**
   - Handles CRUD operations by sending AJAX requests to the backend and updating the frontend dynamically based on the responses.
